There are two locations where a new comment can be added with the public API:

A page.
An existing discussion thread.

The request body will differ slightly depending on which type of comment is being added with this endpoint.
To add a new comment to a page, aÂ parentÂ object with a page_id must be provided in the body params. 
To add a new comment to an existing discussion thread, aÂ discussion_idÂ string must be provided in the body params. (Inline comments to start a new discussion thread cannot be created via the public API.)
Either the parent.page_id or discussion_id parameter must be provided â€” not both.
To see additional examples of creating a page or discussion comment and to learn more about comments in Notion, see the Working with comments guide.
