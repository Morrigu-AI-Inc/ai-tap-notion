Responses contains pageÂ properties, not page content. To fetch page content, use theÂ Retrieve block childrenÂ endpoint.
Page properties are limited to up to 25 references per page property. To retrieve data related to properties that have more than 25 references, use the Retrieve a page property endpoint. (See Limits below for additional information.)
Parent objects: Pages vs. databases
If a pageâ€™sÂ Parent objectÂ is a database, then the property values will conform to theÂ database property schema. 
If a page object is not part of a database, then the only property value available for that page is itsÂ title.
Limits
The endpoint returns a maximum of 25 page or person references per page property. If a page property includes more than 25 references, then the 26th reference and beyond might be returned as Untitled, Anonymous, or not be returned at all. 
This limit affects the following properties: 

people: response object canâ€™t be guaranteed to return more than 25 people.
relation: the has_more value of the relation in the response object is true if a relation contains more than 25 related pages. Otherwise, has_more is false.
rich_text: response object includes a maximum of 25 populated inline page or person mentions.
title: response object includes a maximum of 25 inline page or person mentions.

ðŸš§This endpoint will not accurately return properties that exceed 25 referencesDo not use this endpoint if a page property includes more than 25 references to receive the full list of references. Instead, use theÂ Retrieve a page property endpointÂ for the specific property to get its complete reference list.
ðŸ“˜Integration capabilitiesThis endpoint requires an integration to have read content capabilities. Attempting to call this API without read content capabilities will return an HTTP response with a 403 status code. For more information on integration capabilities, see the capabilities guide.
Errors
Returns a 404 HTTP response if the page doesn't exist, or if the integration doesn't have access to the page.
Returns a 400 or 429 HTTP response if the request exceeds the request limits.
Note: Each Public API endpoint can return several possible error codes. See the Error codes section of the Status codes documentation for more information.
